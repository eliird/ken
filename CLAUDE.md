## Implementation Notes

### Command Structure
All commands follow this pattern:
1. Parse command parameters
2. Use `query_with_context()` to enhance with project context
3. Call appropriate GitLab MCP tools
4. Format response clearly
5. Provide actionable suggestions

### Data Presentation
- Use tables for lists (emoji + text)
- Color coding: üî¥ Critical, üü° Warning, üü¢ Good
- Always show actionable next steps
- Include command suggestions for follow-up

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Clear error messages
- Suggest alternatives when tools fail

## Testing Checklist

For each feature:
- [ ] Command parses correctly
- [ ] GitLab API calls work
- [ ] Data formats properly
- [ ] Error cases handled
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Help text updated

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 (Workload Management)
2. Test each command thoroughly
3. Gather user feedback
4. Iterate and improve
5. Move to next phase
